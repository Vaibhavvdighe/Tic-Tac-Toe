        <h2>Some basic Rules for you</h2>  
        <ul>
            <li>This is a 2-player game. One is 'X' and other is 'O'.</li>
            <li>Be the first to get three of your marks in a row (Horizontally, Vertically or Diagonally)</li>
            <li>If all the squares are filled and none of the player has occupied three slots in a row, column or diagonal the game is a draw.</li>
            <li>note: <span class="note">Will soon develop a game which can be played with a computer</span></li>
